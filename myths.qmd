# About CPAL
CPAL is a Dallas-based nonprofit organization committed to cutting child poverty in
Dallas, Texas in half within a generation by (1) generating relevant data insights to break big problems into small, actionable ones, (2) facilitating cross-sector, collective action based on data insights, and (3) applying principles of human-centered design to solve problems in partnership with communities. One of CPAL’s five areas of focus is housing, and CPAL’s long-term aspiration is to ensure all Dallas families have access to stable housing without worry of an involuntary move.
